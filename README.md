**Code weaves dreams, line by line, a universe unfolds in time.**

Hello, I'm Jiang Muran. You can call me Andy Jiang or simply Jiang. Back in China, my classmates often refer to me as JMR.

🌱 I’m currently a student from Beijing. My studies are quite demanding, so I dedicate a significant amount of time to them. Beyond academics, I actively participate in programming competitions and mathematical modeling contests. I also enjoy tinkering with little projects on my own. If you're interested, feel free to collaborate with me—I’d be happy to connect!

Welcome to the internet!
