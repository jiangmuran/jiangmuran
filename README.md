## About Me

Born in Beijing, raised in the digital age. To me, code is not merely a competition, but a logical language used to deconstruct the world. My goal is to discern patterns within the noise and simulate the texture of reality through algorithms.

In competitions, I tackle problems with data structures and mathematical models. Beyond the contest, I am an explorer. From embedded systems to server architecture, every line of code is a conversation with the technological world.

Beyond rationality, sensibility is essential for harmony. In Western pop and rock, I seek a resonance that transcends the mundane. Music is not just background noise—it is the fuel that keeps my thoughts flowing.

Stay curious, keep building. May we leave our mark in the fabric of the internet.
